Multiple instances of Mednafen using the same base directory should not run simultaneously, otherwise settings file changes may be lost, along with other similar problems.  If you understand the risks, and want to anyway, run Mednafen with environment variable "MEDNAFEN_ALLOWMULTI" set to "1" to bypass this check.
